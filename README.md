# About this project

With the use of the Text To Speech (TTS) technology, your written words can be spoken aloud. You may turn your text into speech in this project (Text To Speech Converter App) using a variety of voices.
Pitch (the position of a single sound across the entire spectrum of sounds) and rate (the number of sounds per second) are added to simplify and improve the user experience.
